# vClaw

**vClaw** is a lightweight VS Code extension designed to simplify code navigation and selection. Using smart indentation and structural analysis, it lets you "grab" code blocks with precision.

## 🚀 Features

- **Snap (Inner):** Instantly captures the current line or the most immediate code block.
- **Grip (Outer):** Expands the selection to the parent scope (e.g., the function containing your code).
- **Clench (Root):** Grasps the entire structure or the root level of the file (HTML tags, Classes, etc.).
- **Release:** Quickly clears all active scope highlights.

## 🛠️ Usage

Right-click anywhere in your code editor and navigate to the **vClaw** menu to start capturing scopes. Perfect for refactoring large YAML, JSON, or HTML files without getting lost in indentations!
